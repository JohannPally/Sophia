Sophia is a low overhead inventory maintenance history application to serve as a digital replacement
for handwritten logs in hospitals in Malawi and Tanzania. Our solution overcomes usability challenges by 
applying language agnostic QR code quick access, internet challenges by offering local and cloud change logging, 
and conflict management with a sophisticated custom packet management protocol.
